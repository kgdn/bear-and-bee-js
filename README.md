Bear and Bee Game

## A couple of details about this project

The work carried out in this lab concentrated on client-side programming using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Objects, Arrays and the DOM API. We had to develop a simple game without any server interactions. Two characters compete on a game board. One character moves randomly and the second is controlled by the user through keyboard keys (up, down, left, right). The game was designed with configurablity in mind, such as adding more bees and controlling their speed. Scores are displayed continuously.
